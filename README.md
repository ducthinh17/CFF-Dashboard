### By  Author: Pham Le Duc Thinh  
### Overview
During my internship at Classic Fine Foods (CFF), I was tasked with developing
several Power BI reports to provide comprehensive insights into the company's sales
performance. The primary focus was on creating reports for monthly and annual sales
analysis across five branches (PQC, NHA, HCM, DAN, HAN), along with product
and customer analytics.
